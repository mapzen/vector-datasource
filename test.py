#
# Put a YAML file in the appropriate config directory (it's
# $HOME/.config/vector-datasource/config.yaml on Linux, but will be different on
# other systems) with keys for each config and values with the URL parameters,
# e.g:
#
#     ---
#     local:
#       url: http://localhost:8080/%(layer)s/%(z)d/%(x)d/%(y)d.json
#       use_all_layers: false
#
# Then you will be able to run `test.py local` and it will run against the local
# server defined above. You can define as many different servers as you like.
#
# Note that setting `use_all_layers` to `true` will cause the test to fetch all
# the layers, which may take more time than just the layers it needs. However,
# this makes it possible to run against the raw storage.
